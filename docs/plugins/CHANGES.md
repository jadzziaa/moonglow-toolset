# Plugin API changes

A plugin's manifest names the API it was written for (`api = "0.2"`).
Moonglow runs a plugin only if it has that API; while the API is at 0.x,
each version may change what the one before had. This file lists each
version's changes and what a plugin written for the version before has
to change.

## 0.2

In Moonglow 1.16.0. Only additions: a plugin written for 0.1 runs as it
is, and its manifest may go on saying `api = "0.1"`. A plugin that uses
what is new says `api = "0.2"`, so that a Moonglow without it refuses it
plainly.

- `ctx.ui:open_file` and `ctx.ui:open_folder`: a file or a folder the
  user chooses, to read (a folder's files, and nothing outside it).
- `ctx.hak:write` and a folder's `to_hak`: resources for a hak of the
  user's hak folder, which the user is asked to allow; `ctx.hak:attach`
  lists a hak in the module. What a job puts into a hak, `ctx.game`
  reads in that job.
- `ctx.terrain`: `tilesets`, `new_area` (an area as the Area Wizard
  makes it) and `open`, an area's terrain to read and paint as the area
  editor's brushes do: `corner`, `tile`, `paint`, `raise`, `set_height`,
  `place_group`, `set_tile`; and, from Moonglow 1.16.1, `cross` (roads,
  streams, walls), `erase` and the list `crossers`.
- `mg.image`: a PNG, TGA or DDS picture decoded, to read its pixels.
- `mg plugin run` takes `--file` (what the plugin gets where it asks for
  a file or folder) and `--hak-dir`.

## 0.1

The first version, in Moonglow 1.0.0. Experimental.

- A manifest, `plugin.cfg`: `[plugin]`, and a `[command]` or `[check]`
  for each thing added.
- `mg.command` and `mg.check` register handlers; typed values
  (`mg.int`…) and `mg.path`.
- A handler's `ctx`: `ctx.module` and `ctx.game` to read, `ctx.edit` for
  a command's changes (fields, list items, whole resources),
  `ctx.log`, `ctx.progress`, `ctx.ui` (message, confirm, form) and
  `ctx.plugin`.
- `require` for the plugin's own files.
